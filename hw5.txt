The DOM is Document Object Model (DOM) which basically specifies how browsers can
 create model of an HTML page and how Javascript is able to gain access to and update the 
  contents of a web page while it's in the browser live page browser. It's essentially the live rendering representation of the said page(HTML) you're viewing.
The DOM is in control of what your script can ask broswers about the current page and how/what to update whatever is being shown to the user.

5. What is a XSS attack? How do they work? How can you guard against them?

Cross-site Scripting Attacks or XSS atacks are when malicous users add codes/injects dangerous/malicious executable scripts to an input,link etc, and said code could potentially be run for different users. 
This is something to be wary of when using innerHTML.
How you should be guarding against that is to be very careful with what content you treat as html
Very rarely shoudl it have the option to have come from a user at all
If it comes down to having options to validate that input, strip it of potential malicious intent by removing tags, escaping characters, etc.
